## My personal touch
Aware, although it was originally built for 'session tracking', that is, it was for tracking how much time you spent with the computer "actively", I wanted it to be personal time tracking application, so I'm adding a couple of new features for my liking

## Features (or changes) implemented so far
Shows how much time was spent today in total

A log txt file of how much time each was spent before the computer went to sleep

## Goals
A nice, pretty GUI parser for the log file, showing how much time was spent day, month, year 

(aiming for ios screentime asthetics)

Perhaps implementing application tracking w/ logo (although it'll be one heck of a challenge)
